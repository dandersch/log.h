#+TITLE: log.h

A single-header C/C++ logging library that allows custom definitions of logging
severities, subsystems and categories through the use of X-Macros.

* Usage
After copying ~log.h~ into your project:

#+BEGIN_SRC C :includes "./log.h"
#define LOG_ENTRIES \
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   INFO,         (1<< 1),    "[INFO ]",     LOG_COLOR_GREEN   )\
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   WARN,         (1<< 2),    "[WARN ]",     LOG_COLOR_YELLOW  )\
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   ERROR,        (1<< 3),    "[ERROR]",     LOG_COLOR_RED     )\
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   FATAL,        (1<< 4),    "[FATAL]",     LOG_COLOR_PURPLE  )\
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  PLATFORM,     (1<<10),    "[PLATF]",     LOG_COLOR_CYAN    )\
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  AUDIO,        (1<<11),    "[AUDIO]",     LOG_COLOR_GREEN   )\
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  VIDEO,        (1<<12),    "[VIDEO]",     LOG_COLOR_RED     )\
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   INIT,         (1<<20),    "[INIT ]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )\
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   SHUTDOWN,     (1<<21),    "[SHUTD]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )\
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   EMPTY0,             0,    "[     ]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )
/*         entry      name            value      string        color             */

#include "log.h"

int log_verbosity_level = LOG_EVERYTHING;

int main()
{
    /* usage */
    LOG(INFO|PLATFORM|INIT,      "Started engine");
    LOG(VIDEO|INIT,              "Successfully initialized video subsystem");

    unsigned int buffer_size = 1024;
    LOG(AUDIO|WARN|INIT,         "Insufficient memory for buffer of size %u", buffer_size);

    /* only log warnings or worse from here */
    LOG_SET_MASK(WARN | ERROR | FATAL); // short form of log_verbosity_level = LOG_SEVERITY_WARN | LOG_SEVERITY_ERROR | LOG_SEVERITY_FATAL;

    LOG(INFO|VIDEO,              "Won't be displayed");
    LOG(FATAL|PLATFORM|SHUTDOWN, "Fatal error occured. Aborting...");
}
#+END_SRC

Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC
19:07:29 [INFO ][PLATF][INIT ]       main.c:  37 Started engine
19:07:29 [     ][VIDEO][INIT ]       main.c:  38 Successfully initialized video subsystem
19:07:29 [WARN ][AUDIO][INIT ]       main.c:  39 Insufficient memory for normal-sized buffer
19:07:29 [FATAL][PLATF][SHUTD]       main.c:  40 Fatal error occured. Aborting...
#+END_SRC

Customize the macros to define your own severities, subsystems and categories
and how each one should be displayed. Here is what every argument to the macro
means:

#+BEGIN_SRC
LOG_ENTRY(name, value,  string, color)
#+END_SRC

- ~entry~: Either ~SEVERITY~, ~SUBSYSTEM~ or ~CATEGORY~
- ~name~: Symbol name of your choice. Will be prefixed in the header file, but can
  be used unprefixed inside the ~LOG(...)~ macro
- ~value~: Bit that identifies the entry in the bitfield. Must be unique for every
  entry.
- ~string~: String to output for that entry in the log line
- ~color~: What color that string should be

You can also move all macro definitions to a separate file. Define
~LOG_ENTRY_FILE~ to be the path to that file before including ~log.h~:

#+BEGIN_SRC C :includes "./log.h"
#define LOG_ENTRY_FILE "log_entry_table.h"
#include "log.h"
#+END_SRC

* Using a ~.def~ file
By default, the ~LOG_ENTRY_FILE~ needs to contain definitions of certain macros
and manually assigned bit values. You can have a more simple file structure by
defining ~LOG_USE_DEF_FILE~ and defining ~LOG_ENTRY_FILE~ to that file
before including ~log.h~. The ~.def~ should look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC C :includes
/*         entry      name          value             string         color            */
#line 0
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   TRACE,        (1<<__LINE__),    "[TRACE]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   INFO,         (1<<__LINE__),    "[INFO ]",     LOG_COLOR_GREEN   )
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   WARN,         (1<<__LINE__),    "[WARN ]",     LOG_COLOR_YELLOW  )
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   ERROR,        (1<<__LINE__),    "[ERROR]",     LOG_COLOR_RED     )
LOG_ENTRY(SEVERITY,   FATAL,        (1<<__LINE__),    "[FATAL]",     LOG_COLOR_PURPLE  )
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  PLATFORM,     (1<<__LINE__),    "[PLATF]",     LOG_COLOR_CYAN    )
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  AUDIO,        (1<<__LINE__),    "[AUDIO]",     LOG_COLOR_GREEN   )
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  VIDEO,        (1<<__LINE__),    "[VIDEO]",     LOG_COLOR_RED     )
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  NETWORK,      (1<<__LINE__),    "[NETWK]",     LOG_COLOR_PURPLE  )
LOG_ENTRY(SUBSYSTEM,  TEST,         (1<<__LINE__),    "[TEST ]",     LOG_COLOR_GREEN   )
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   INIT,         (1<<__LINE__),    "[INIT ]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   SHUTDOWN,     (1<<__LINE__),    "[SHUTD]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   ACTIVATE,     (1<<__LINE__),    "[ACTIV]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   DEACTIVATE,   (1<<__LINE__),    "[DEACT]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )
/* special entry: what to display when no severity/subsystem/category is passed       */
LOG_ENTRY(CATEGORY,   EMPTY,                    0,    "[     ]",     LOG_COLOR_GRAY    )
#+END_SRC

With this file structure, you can use the ~__LINE__~ macro to avoid manually
assigning bits.

Having the logging definitions in a separate file eliminates the possibility of
having shortened names in the ~LOG(..)~ macro like above (due to restrictions with
the preprocessor). This means you would now have to write ~LOG(LOG_SEVERITY_TRACE, "...")~
instead of ~LOG(TRACE, "...")~.

However, you can optionally put the shortened versions in the global namespace
by defining ~LOG_USE_SHORT_NAMES_GLOBALLY~ before including ~"log.h"~

#+BEGIN_SRC C :includes "log.h"
#define LOG_ENTRY_FILE "log_entry_table.h"
#define LOG_USE_DEF_FILE
#define LOG_USE_SHORT_NAMES_GLOBALLY
#include "log.h"
#+END_SRC

This is more likely to cause name collisions, but since you are in full control
of what the symbol names are, this can be easily mitigated.

* Configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC C
/* file that contains log entry definitions (optional) */
#define LOG_ENTRY_FILE     "my_table.h"

/* color & format for time strings, set to "" to have no timestamps */
#define LOG_TIME_FORMAT    LOG_COLOR_GRAY "%H:%M:%S "

/* global verbosity level variable name (default: log_verbosity_level) */
#define LOG_VARIABLE_NAME  my_log_level

/* don't color the output */
#define LOG_USE_NO_COLOR

/* allow global usage of e.g. TRACE instead of LOG_SEVERITY_TRACE and so on */
#define LOG_USE_SHORT_NAMES_GLOBALLY

/* use a plain entry file (gets #included in log.h instead of using macro definitions) */
#define LOG_USE_PLAIN_ENTRY_FILE
#+END_SRC

* Limitations
- Because the implementation is using a bitfield based on the entries in an
  enum, the amount of log entries (i.e. the sum of severity levels, subsystems
  and categories) *cannot be more than 32*. More specifically, no entry can have a
  value set higher than (1<<32).
- If you are specifying your log entries, you have to specify its value (i.e.
  the bit that is set for it) yourself. If using a plain entry file, you can use
  the ~__LINE__~ macro to do this job for you.
- You can only combine one severity with one subsystem and one category. E.g.,
  ~LOG(TRACE|WARN)~ would be an invalid combination and give you an empty string
  for the severity.

* About
This is essentially an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Macro][X-Macro]] version of the [[https://github.com/MetricPanda/loggen][loggen]] library, which eliminates
the necessity of a code-generation step in your build script by relying on the C
preprocessor instead (but is also less powerful because of this).
